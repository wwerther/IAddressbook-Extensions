iCal support for iAddressbook
-----------------------------

                                      written by Walter Werther <walter@wwerther.de>

 This part of code extracts all valid birthdates from the database and generates
 an ics-file that can be used e.g. in the Lightning-Plugin of Thunderbird to display
 all birthdays of all your contacts.

 supports user authentication in the same manner as it is done in iAddressbook.
 added a new authorisation group named 'ical_getcalendar'
 User has to have access to this group to use this component

add these lines to conf/auth.php
---- 8< --- 8< ---  8< ---  8< ---  8< ---  8< ---  8< ---  8< ---  8< --- 
$auth['calendar']['password']    = '--- enter your md5 sum here  ---';
$auth['calendar']['permissions'] = array();
$auth['calendar']['groups']      = array('@ical_client');
$auth['@ical_client']['permissions']  = array('ical_getcalendar');
---- >8 --- >8 --- >8 --- >8 --- >8 --- >8 --- >8 --- >8 --- >8 --- >8 --- >8 


      2008-09-03 <walter@wwerther.de>: rewrote pieces of the code, so it can 
                 be used in iAddressbook (http://iaddressbook.org/) 
                 I think it is not 100% compatible anymore, but works fine for
                 this use-case
      based on libs from http://idmi.poly.edu/pdlab/ical-with-fixes-2006-10-10.zip
      based on iCal component by Michael Wimmer <flaimo@gmx.net>
